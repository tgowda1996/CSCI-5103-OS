Submission Summary:
Intermediate implementation including Lock and CondVar classes. Following Hoare semantics for CondVar. 
Checking fuctionality using the main.cpp. Creating user specified number of producers and consumers that will run until killed
or joined. 
In the given test file, there are multiple assert statements tactically placed to verify the invariants related to the buffered queue. These assert statements make sure that the lock and the condition variables are working correctly.
