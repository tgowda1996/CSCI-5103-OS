You should implement the async_read() and async_write() functions to provide a mechanism for supporting asynchronous I/O (refer to async_io.h).
These functions will initiate an I/O request with the operating system and then switch to another uthread thread until successfully polling for completion. This means that the asynchronous I/O functions will be synchronous with respect to the calling thread but asynchronous in terms of letting other threads complete work in the meantime. The aio_read(), aio_write(), aio_error(), and aio_return() system calls (refer to their man pages) will be helpful for carrying out asynchronous I/O requests.
